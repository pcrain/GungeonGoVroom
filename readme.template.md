## What Is This Mod?

Gungeon Go Vroom fixes several bugs in vanilla Enter the Gungeon's code, and optimizes several other parts of Gungeon's code to reduce CPU usage, RAM usage, and lag spike frequency. Each fix and optimization can be individually toggled via the Mod Config menu (Options -> Mod Config -> Gungeon Go Vroom). **NOTE:** For safety and performance reasons, most changes will only take effect upon restarting the game.

Gungeon Go Vroom's changes are organized into three main categories:

### Bugfixes

These are changes that modify vanilla Gungeon's behavior to fix various bugs with the game. By their nature, these changes are NOT suitable for players who require unaltered vanilla functionality (e.g., for speedrunning leaderboards), but should otherwise improve the experience for vanilla and modded players alike. All bugfixes are enabled by default.

Currently included bugfixes are:
{bugfixes}

### Safe Optimizations

These are changes that improve Gungeon's performance without altering vanilla behavior, and which have a negligible chance of interfering with other mods. Safe optimizations should be suitable for all players, and are all enabled by default.

Currently included safe optimizations are:
{safe}

### Aggressive Optimizations

These are changes that improve Gungeon's performance without altering vanilla behavior, but could theoretically interfere with other mods. While these optimizations currently have no known compatibility issues with other mods and should be suitable for all players, they are all *DISABLED* by default.

Currently included aggressive optimizations are:
{aggressive}
